## 🧠 Development of a Web Application for Textual File Processing with AI

This repository contains the full implementation, documentation, and presentation of our final year project: an **AI-powered chatbot** that allows users to interact with PDF documents using natural language.

### 📄 Project Description

In today's information-heavy digital world, users often struggle to find relevant content in large PDF files. Traditional keyword search tools lack contextual understanding and can overwhelm users with irrelevant results. To overcome these limitations, we developed a **web-based chatbot** that enables users to:

* Upload one or more PDF documents.
* Ask questions in natural language.
* Receive accurate, context-aware answers.
* Summarize full documents or selected parts.
* Extract specific information such as names, dates, or statistics.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Python**: Core development language.
* **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
* **LangChain**: Manages LLM interactions and memory.
* **Hugging Face Transformers**: Embedding and NLP tasks.
* **FAISS**: Efficient vector search for semantic similarity.
* **GPT-3.5 Turbo** and **LLaMA 3**: For language understanding and response generation.

### 📁 Repository Contents

* `app2.py/`: Full Python backend and Streamlit frontend implementation.
* `PFE-license-Chatbot.pdf`: Full documentation of the project (converted from Word).
* `poster.pdf`: Project presentation poster used during the final defense.
* `README.md`: Setup instructions and user guide (you can adapt this content for the README too).
